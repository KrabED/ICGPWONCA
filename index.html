I am writing to raise my concern as a citizen of Ireland, a country where the majority of us stand with the Palestinian struggle for freedom and their right to exist free from occupation. I ask you to please read and consider this email in its entirety.

I cannot see any reason fit that your organisation, especially the Irish College of General Practitioners, would not have identified a concern with Irish doctors, especially given our own intense history of oppression and occupation. To be addressed by one who's nation has been responsible for near total destruction of the entire healthcare system in Gaza since October 7th, including the death of countless healthcare workers and the denial of even the most basic medical supplies. We do not want this doctor to be platformed as a role model to our health care workers for many reasons, some of which will be stated below.

After only two months of Israels brutal military campaign against the people of Gaza, UNICEF estimated that a thousand children in Gaza had become amputees, "The biggest cohort of paediatric amputees in history", many of them operated on without any anaesthesia or even analgesia. It has been 8 more months of escalating destruction and carpet bombing since then and one couldn't bare to imagine the current figures of paediatric amputees and deaths.

Disease has been allowed to spread as a result of denial of clean drinking water and decimation of sanitary infrastructure, with many suffering from hepatitis on a weekly basis, including members of my own family. Horrifyingly the resurgence of polio has also been noted and despite Israel caving in to pressure to allow the UN to vaccinate children, they have continued to bomb them in between. How many hospitals must be bombed, how many must die at the hands of treatable illness and how many healthcare workers must face their own death or the death of their patients without the most basic tools to carry out their duty to preserving life.

Though the confirmed death toll is over 40,000 people, a paper in the Lancet suggested that the estimate at the time would not unreasonably be 186,000 in actuality. This is unsurprising considering many factors including individuals vaporised from bombing, and countless individuals yet to be found under rubble of which there is an estimated 42 million tonnes of debris, enough to fill a line of trucks from New York to Singapore. All of this is only in relation to Gaza, for decades across internationally recognised Palestinian Territories, Israel has been holding ambulances at checkpoints, preventing first responders from reaching the injured, creating multi-day travel necessary for Palestinian cancer patients to travel only kilometers to receive treatment and more.

Therefore, it is with great upset that I'm writing to you regarding the upcoming WONCA conference after discovering that one of the keynote speakers, and president of WONCA, is an Israeli doctor (and likely reserve given Israels mandatory conscription) who has not condemned the atrocities on human kind his country continually commits, as recognised by countless human rights groups including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Israeli B’Tselem.

To allow this address to our doctors of Ireland, a country that has faced such intense and prolonged suffering under our own brutal occupation, is a grave and nauseating mistake that should never be allowed to happen. Israel is on notice by the International Criminal Court for plausible genocide and the International Court of Justice, who ruled on the 19th of July that Israel is an apartheid state following an investigation triggered in 2022, these facts alone should substantiate preventing Dr. Shlomo Vinker from being given a platform unless he decides to denounce the deplorable actions of his nation.
